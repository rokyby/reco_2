It takes the bulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights, offering more diverse sniper challenges; a rebuilt AI system and the thrilling “one shot, one kill” precision that made the original a huge hit, selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 also delivers striking graphic environments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features<\/h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tMotion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in real-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the pad’s trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.<br><\/li><li>\tRealistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the realism of its shooting dynamics.  Wind speed, distance, gravity and bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.<br><\/li><li>\tRefined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your round, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head. From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper must pull together everything to achieve the ideal “one shot; one kill.”<br><\/li><li>\tImproved Enemy AI: the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was completely re-tooled and designed from scratch.  Much of the improvements were made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything from flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage you in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.<br><\/li><li>\tNew Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever. <br><\/li><li>\tVarious Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible to the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to play – either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and experience the game on Expert Mode.<br><\/li><li>\tBullet-Cam: everyone’s favorite feature returns to reward expert shots and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint. See what the transfer of kinetic energy – a bullet’s true stopping power – can do to the enemy from 1000 meters or more!<br><\/li><li>\tBullet Penetration: concealment doesn’t necessarily mean cover. In Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, bullets behave as they would in real life and are able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You can also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an entire squad. Wait ‘til you see that on Bullet Cam!<br><\/li><li>\tExpanded List of Sniper Rifles: Try out the world’s most advanced sniper rifles, each of them meticulously recreated so that they accurately simulate the modern weaponry found on today’s battlefields.<br><\/li><li>\tNew Gear: own the night with the introduction of thermal and night vision optics, plus a pair of powerful binoculars critical for locating the enemy before they spot you.<\/li><\/ul>",

There is also a turn-based strategic campaign mode which ties the tactical fights together, featuring persistent terrains that will accumulate the battle scars, debris, and bunker ruins through your entire campaign. <br><br>Choose from several unique technology factions, each featuring their own sets of expendable soldier bodies, mechas, weapons, tools, and landing craft. Protect your brain, mine the gold, and destroy the enemy cortex in his bunker complex!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Fully destructible environments<\/strong> - The gold you need to excavate is sprinkled throughout the terrain of each scene. Use special digging tools to blast your way into the dirt and debris. All the pieces of bodies and ships from your struggles will fall to the ground and permanently add to the battlefield. Get more powerful (and expensive) diggers and you can even tunnel into your enemies' bunkers from below!<br><br><\/li><li><strong>Strategic metagame campaign<\/strong> – The intense, real-time tactical battles are put in a greater strategic context in the Campaign mode, thus giving each battle meaning and consequence. The gold-rich terrains on the planet and the defensive bunkers you build to defend them are persistent from fight to fight. This means there will be layers of debris, bunker ruins, tunnels, and corpses piled up in layers, telling the history of each place throughout each campaign played.<br><br><\/li><li><strong>In-game buying menu<\/strong> - At any time and place during the game, bring up a powerful menu to order new bodies and equipment, all delivered at the location and by the transport ship of your choosing. Rockets are cheaper but unreliable and harder to land. Drop ships are far more expensive but can quickly deploy entire groups of puppets onto difficult terrain. Ships and equipment returned to the TradeStar are refunded to your account.<br><br><\/li><li><strong>Build your own bunker<\/strong> - At the start of most missions, you are able to take your time and build your own command bunker from scratch. Easily design twisting tunnels and place doors, traps, and turrets to thwart your enemies' intrusions! Pre-deploy and equip bodies in and around your installation to prepare yourself for your objectives. Don't spend too much though, or you won't have enough funds left when the mission starts!<br><br><\/li><li><strong>Four-player cooperative and\/or versus multiplayer<\/strong> - Gather your friends and plug in those game controllers! Play skirmish or campaign missions with or against up to three of your buddies. 2 vs 2, 1 vs. 3, 4 vs. the CPU - it's up to you! (rhyme intended). Flexible control settings allow you to use the keyboard, keyboard + mouse, or any generic game controller you can find and plug in.<br><br><\/li><li><strong>Built-in editors and modding<\/strong> - Several in-game editors allow you to easily create your own stuff. The game's engine is built to make it very simple to modify and add your own content. Design your own missions, guys, ships, weapons, tools, bombs, and shields - and easily share them with your friends. Join and download some fantastic mods from the community at the Data Realms Fan Forums.<\/li><\/ul>",

Here, the ruins of a great civilization of Aliens have recently been discovered. Huge factories and sprawling cities are falling into decay.

So looters continue to come here, to find the Aliens’ lost treasures — and to fight for them.<\/strong>",

Es gibt nur Chernarus – ein 230 Quadratkilometer großes, post-sowjetisches Land, das von einem unbekannten Virus heimgesucht und dessen Bevölkerung zu einem Großteil in rasende Infizierte verwandelt wurde.<br><br>Deine Aufgabe? Überlebe den Zusammenbruch der Zivilisation, solange du kannst. Vergiss nie: Im gnadenlosen Chernarus ist der Tod endgültig. Alles, was du bei einem neuen Versuch hast, sind deine Erinnerungen an deinen letzten, fatalen Fehler.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/221100\/extras\/infectedv2.gif?t=1674143992\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Triff andere<\/h2><br>Im Spiel kämpfen zu jedem Zeitpunkt bis zu 60 Spieler mit allen Mitteln ums Überleben. Finde Freunde oder töte, ohne Fragen zu stellen. Errichte eine Basis – und versuche, nicht wegen einer Dose schmackhafter Bohnen verraten zu werden. Interagiere per Sprachchat (VOIP) mit anderen Spielern. Wenn dein Leben ständig auf Messers Schneide steht, ist jede Begegnung bedeutsam. Sei vorsichtig. Bleib wachsam. Vertraue niemandem.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/221100\/extras\/meetothers.gif?t=1674143992\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Überlebe Chernarus<\/h2><br>Die Infizierten sind nicht deine einzige Sorge. Wilde Tiere und die Elemente tun ihr Übriges. Gehe Wolfsrudeln und rasenden Bären aus dem Weg, finde einen Unterschlupf, um dich gegen den erbarmungslosen Regen zu schützen und suche in der finsteren Nacht nach Lichtquellen. Hunger, Durst, Körpertemperatur und mehr – um zu überleben, musst du komplexe Spielmechaniken meistern.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/221100\/extras\/survive+navigation_v2.gif?t=1674143992\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mach Beute<\/h2><br>Achte darauf, dass deine Ausrüstung stets einsatzbereit ist. Flicke beschädigte Kleidung, stelle improvisierte Gegenstände her und suche verdächtig ruhig wirkende Städte auf, um wertvolle Ressourcen zu plündern. Repariere ein Auto und verstecke es, geschützt von ein paar gut platzierten Fallen, in deiner geheimen Basis. Wag dich in kontaminierte Zonen vor und halte Ausschau nach wertvoller Beute. Aber vergiss nicht: Ohne Schutzanzug und Gasmaske wirst du nicht weit kommen.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/221100\/extras\/contaminated.gif?t=1674143992\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Schieß dir den Weg frei<\/h2><br>Im Spiel kann jederzeit und überall heftige PvP-Action losbrechen, vor allem natürlich an beliebten Orten wie verlassenen Militärbasen. Lass deinen Puls bei gnadenlosen Feuergefechten in die Höhe schnellen. Einige Überlebende haben es auf deine Beute abgesehen, andere jagen dich nur zum Spaß. Und manche haben einfach nur Angst, dass du zuerst schießt. Lerne zu kämpfen – und wann es besser ist, deinen Stolz herunterzuschlucken und zu fliehen. Eine Kugel kann alles verändern. Also sei auf der Hut.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/221100\/extras\/takeyourshotv2.gif?t=1674143992\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Installiere Mods<\/h2><br>Im Steam Workshop kannst du individuelle Server finden, die zu deinen Bedürfnissen passen.

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.<br><br><i>Firefight<\/i> --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish<\/i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br><br><i>Occupy<\/i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or &quot;tug of war&quot;.<br><br><i>Ambush<\/i> --- A high value target (&quot;HVT&quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.<br><br><i>Strike<\/i> --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.<br><br><i>Infiltrate<\/i> --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.<br><br><i>Flashpoint<\/i> --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.<br><br><i>Elimination<\/i> --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cooperative Game Modes<\/h2><br><i>Checkpoint<\/i> --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.<br><br><i>Hunt<\/i> --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life.<br><br><i>Survival<\/i> --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.<br><br><i>Outpost<\/i> --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates.<br><br><i>Conquer<\/i> --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.",

Soon Ubersreik is a charnel-town, drowning beneath the malevolent shadow of the Horned Rat. <br><br>Yet even in the darkest times, there are always champions to light the way. As Ubersreik cowers, five heroes, united by capricious fate, carry the fight to the rat-men. It remains to be seen whether they have the strength to survive, let alone work together long enough to thwart the invaders. One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them. <\/i>",

This allows Celestia to support his allies through healing and buffs, while also allowing him to rain down meteorites, stars and even planets upon his enemies. But be cautious as the entropic nature of Space may be difficult to control leading to side-effects - both good and bad. <br> <br>During the period of Celestia’s Launch, Elsword will be celebrating the Noah 2nd Path Update Event which is specially designed to help jumpstart your Celestia with rewards like 50% EXP Boost Medal, Consumable Potions, Mounts and more! Furthermore, once you finish the event, you can claim a [Luriel] Mark of Bonding which is an exclusive Celestia-based accessory created for this event!<br> <br>In addition, login during the weekend for the Noah 2nd Path Update Special Weekend Event!

A conspiracy against the king catapults the captain into a situation where he finds himself responsible for the defence of the last royal province. This is all that remains of the shattered kingdom, which has been split into numerous small principalities and fiefdoms. And now even the king himself, ensconced in his capital, is threatened by enemy armies. This is the starting point of your Middle Ages adventure. Now you must win back all those provinces which once belonged to your king.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE SHATTERED KINGDOM:<\/strong><\/h2>After many battles, a former kingdom has been divided into many small principalities and earldoms. The kingís troops were pushed back into one last royal province, and the rulers of the other provinces waged terrible, destructive wars against one another. The whole land fell into a state of chaos and now the former royal capital itself is under<br>siege by the armies of the rebel lords. You belong to the last remaining group of loyal kingís men, and have been commanded to go to the king in view of the imminent<br>attack.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE PEASANTS REBELLION:<\/strong><\/h2>Build a prosperous settlement with a complete economy.

Try World of Guns: the world’s most realistic 3D simulator of firearms (and other things from tanks to DeLorean time machines). Find out what makes legendary pistols, rifles, machine guns and artillery pieces tick… Then disassemble them down to the tiniest part!<br><br>WHAT IS WORLD OF GUNS?<br>A free-to-play game and an interactive encyclopedia, simulating real firearms in 3D. Here, you can literally climb inside a gun and understand its workings; cut it in half, fire it and bring time to a crawl; and finally, completely disassemble it and put it back again (against the clock if you wish).<br><br>WoG meticulously recreates historical and modern examples of firearm designer genius — from a tiny Liberator pistol to a 16000-pound FlaK 88 anti-aircraft gun. It has both legendary World War guns and rare models that even museums struggle to find.

To create each model, our team spends months poring over actual guns, photos, blueprints and documents. Each part out of hundreds functions in a physically correct way – exactly as it does in a real thing. There are few ways to understand the different firearm actions and systems as clearly.<br><br>CONSTANT UPDATES <br>Noble Empire releases several new models every month, and improves the older ones.

It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the <strong>AI Storyteller<\/strong>. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.<br><br><strong>Your colonists are not professional settlers<\/strong> – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.<br><br><strong>Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play.<\/strong> A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.<br><br><strong>Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.<\/strong> Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.<br><br><strong>The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.<\/strong> You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.<br><br><strong>Travel across the planet.<\/strong> You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.<br><br><strong>You can tame and train animals.<\/strong> Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.<br><br><strong>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.<\/strong> They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.<br><br><strong>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.<\/strong> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.<br><br><strong>You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.<\/strong> A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.<br><br>And there's much more than that!

The world around you is full of danger, and you must face it – alone. Separated from your family in a devastating flood, you will need to find food and shelter between terrifying torrential downpours which threaten to drown all life. Climb through the ruins of an ancient civilization, evade the jaws of vicious predators, and discover new lands teeming with strange creatures and buried mysteries. Find your family before something makes a meal of you!<br><br>Inspired by the simplicity and aesthetics of 16-bit classics, this survival platformer requires clever decision-making, both to catch your own prey and to avoid the jaws of hungry predators. Each ravenous foe in your path will be cunning, vicious and always on the hunt – eager to sink their teeth into you, or even each other. As a small, soft slugcat you must rely on stealth and wit rather than force: learn the ecosystem and turn their strengths to your advantage. Maybe then you can survive… Rain World!<\/li><\/ul>",

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.<br><br>From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!<br><br>Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?<br><br><i>&quot;For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.&quot;<\/i> <strong>-Joel Couture <a href=\"http:\/\/IndieGameMag.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"  >IndieGameMag.com<\/a> <\/strong><br><br>This game was created using Clickteam Fusion!",

You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. <br><br>Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making.

Now surviving as a reclusive mercenary on the edge of a corrupted world, the formidable warrior must again wield a devastating combination of guns, blades, magic and wit to strike down the demonic legions overwhelming the world. Battle alongside allies online in four-player co-op or go it alone in spectacular procedurally-generated landscapes to complete daring missions and collect powerful new weapons, armor, and arcane relics of legend.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY<\/h2>Five years have passed since Lo Wang shattered the alliance between his deceitful former boss and the ancient gods of the shadow realm. Despite noble intentions, Lo Wang’s efforts to annihilate the darkness corrupted the world, creating a strange and savage new order where humans and demons live side by side. <br><br>The once feared warrior now lives in the shifting wildlands outside the reach of his enemies and the neon glow of Zilla’s cybernetic metropolis, scratching out a meager existence as a hired sword for the local Yakuza clans. When a simple mission goes wrong, Lo Wang is drawn into a volatile conflict between a brilliant young scientist, his nemesis Orochi Zilla, and the demonic forces that have become unsettled in our world. The sharp-tongued hero must once again wield lethal blades, staggering firepower, and archaic magic to purge the world of evil.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES<\/h2><br><strong>Blades and Bullets:<\/strong> Lo Wang delivers his own brand full throttle brutality with an expanded array of over 70 lethal blades and explosive firearms to overcome the demonic opposition. Become a whirlwind of steel and blood with razor sharp katana, short swords, crescent blades, and hand claws or unleash a hellish symphony of ornate firearms to decimate your enemies.<br><br><strong>Four Player Co-Op:<\/strong> Battle through the expansive campaign alone or team up as a four-player typhoon of destruction online in campaign co-op mode. Tackle challenging primary missions or thrilling side quests while maintaining your own ninja style with customizable armor, items, and valuable loot from your triumphs.<br><br><strong>Procedural Environments:<\/strong> The breach between the human and demon realms created an interdimensional hernia resulting in constant shifts to the world of Shadow Warrior 2. Procedurally generated landscapes and paths bring new twists and turns to once familiar terrain and routine missions. <br><br><strong>Brutal Damage System:<\/strong> Choose your weapon based on the situation at hand and then dismantle everything that stands in your path with an advanced gore system. Use precision blade strikes to separate limbs and heads or switch to heavy ordinance and blow a hole right through colossal beasts.<br><br><strong>Custom Upgrade System:<\/strong> Upgrade weapons in your arsenal with up to three stones at once to improve performance or augment them with devastating elemental effects. Collect karma, amulets, and armor to enhance Lo Wang’s power and shift his death-dealing artistry into overdrive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shadow Warrior Series<\/h2><br>The Shadow Warrior series started back in the 90s with Shadow Warrior Classic that was remastered and released on Steam by Devolver Digital and 3D Realms as Shadow Warrior Classic Redux. Then in 2013, Flying Wild Hog and Devolver Digital released the bold reimagining of the legend of Lo Wang with the modern classic Shadow Warrior.<br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/233130\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"  id=\"dynamiclink_1\" >http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/233130\/<\/a><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/225160\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\" >http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/225160\/<\/a><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/238070\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"  >http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/238070\/<\/a>",

Well, if you decide to Recycle the cards you get from these cases you'll be earning a little more Fragments on average over time than you were before.<br><br>With this update we've also added your Fragment balance to the front-end menu so you always know how many you have.

These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch?

Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows!<br><br><strong>Judgement <\/strong><br><br>During this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain.

Survivors will conclude the ARK storyline while adventuring through exotic new worlds with all-new mission-based gameplay. Discover, utilize and master new creatures, new craftable items, weapons, and structures unlike anything you have seen yet! The saga is now complete, and hundreds of hours of new story-oriented ARK gameplay await you!<br><br>Purchased as part of the ARK: Genesis Season Pass you gain access to two new huge story-oriented expansion packs -- Genesis Part 1 and Genesis Part 2 (new!) -- as well as a 'Noglin' Chibi cosmetic, a ‘Shadowmane’ Chibi cosmetic, a new cosmetic armor set, and an in-game, artificially intelligent companion called ‘HLN-A’ who can scan additional hidden Explorer Notes found throughout the other ARKs. <br><br>Features the voiceover talent of David Tennant (Doctor Who, Good Omens) playing the villainous Sir Edmund Rockwell, and Madeleine Madden (The Wheel of Time, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dora and the Lost City of Gold) as in-game robotic AI companion HLN-A\/Helena Walker.<br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1113410\/ARK_Genesis_Season_Pass\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\" >https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1113410\/ARK_Genesis_Season_Pass\/<\/a><\/p><br><h1>Über das Spiel<\/h1>Als ein nackte\/r Mann\/Frau frierend und hungrig auf einer mysteriösen Insel gestrandet, musst du jagen, sammeln, Gegenstände fertigen, Früchte anpflanzen und einen Unterschlupf bauen, um zu überleben. Benutze Geschick und List, um auf ARK lebende Dinosaurier und urzeitliche Lebewesen zu töten, auszubrüten und zu reiten und verbünde dich mit Hunderten von Spielern oder spiele lokal! <br><br>Die folgenden Features sind im Spiel seit dem Tag 1 Early Access release. Wir haben noch viele weitere Aspekte und Verfeinerungen für die fortlaufende Entwicklung geplant. Hier findest du, was du bisher in ARK erleben kannst: <br><br>ZÄHME, TRAINIERE, ZÜCHTE UND REITE DINOSAURIER IN EINEM LEBENDEN ÖKOSYSTEM<br><br>Dinosaurier, Kreaturen &amp; Züchten -- Über 50+ beim Start der Early Access und 100+ sind bis zum finalen Release geplant -- können mit einem herausfordernden Fang- und Anziehungsprozess gezähmt werden. Mit einbezogen ist das schwächen einer wilden Kreatur um sie bewusstlos zu schlagen und anschließend wieder mithilfe der richtigen Nahrung aufzupäppeln. Einmal gezähmt kannst du deinem Hausdino befehle geben, welchen er auch folgt, ganz davon abhängig, wie gut du es trainiert und gezähmt hast. Haudinos können im Level aufsteigen und benötigen Nahrung. Außerdem kannst du Ihnen Rüstungen geben, Items, die sie für dich tragen sollen, sie können jagen und die Beute in deine Basis bringen. Dies ist abhängig von ihrer Stärke. Größere Tiere können gesattelt werden um sie zu reiten. Fliege mit einem Pterodactyl über schneebedeckte Berge, hebe Verbündete über Wälle, renne mit einem Rudel Raptoren durch den Dschungel, trample auf einem gigantischen Brontosaurus über eine gegnerische Basis oder jage deine Beute auf dem Rücken eines wütenden T-Rex! Sei Teil eines dynamischen Ökosystemzyklus mit seiner eigenen Raubtier- und Beutehierarchie in der du nur eine Kreatur zwischen vielen, verschiedenen Spezies im Kampf um die Dominanz und das Überleben bist. Hausdinos können sich unter anderem mit dem anderen Geschlecht paaren, um selektives Züchten erfolgreicher Generation mithilfe eines merkmalbasierten Systems und dem erneuten kombinieren genetischen Erbguts zu ermöglichen. Dieser Prozess schließt unter anderem Ei-basierte Inkubation und Schwangerschaft bei Säugetieren ein. Oder, kurz gesagt, züchte und ziehe Dinobabies groß! <br><br>NAHRUNG, WASSER, TEMPERATUR UND WETTER<br><br>Du musst essen und trinken um zu überleben - mit verschiedenen Pflanzen und Fleischsorten mit unterschiedlichen Attributen, einschließlich Menschenfleisch. Eine funktionierende Wasserversorgung in deinem Zuhause und Inventar ist notwendig. Jede physische Aktion kosten dich Essen und Trinken, weitreichende Reisen stecken voller Gefahren. Das Gewicht deines Inventars macht dich langsamer, der Tag\/Nachtzyklus zusammen mit zufällig generierten Wetterbedingungen fügen eine weitere Herausforderungen hinzu, während sich die Temperaturen ändern, dich schneller hungern lassen oder durstig machen. Baue ein Lagerfeuer oder eine Behausung sowie eine große Auswahl an Kleidung und Rüstung um dich gegen regionale Gefahren und extreme Temperaturschwankungen mithilfe des dynamischen In\/Outdoor-Isolations-Berechnungssystems zu schützen! <br><br>ERNTE, BAUE STRUKTUREN, FÄRBE GEGENSTÄNDE EIN<br><br>Während du sowohl ganze Wälder fällen und Metall und andere wertvolle Ressourcen abbauen kannst, kannst du auch massive, mehrstöckige Bauwerke aus komplexen, einrastenden Teilen bauen. Mit eingeschlossen sind Rampen, Säulen, Fenster, Türen, Tore, ferngesteuerte Tore, Falltüren, Wasserrohre, Wasserhähne, Generatoren, Kabel, jede Menge anderer elektrischer Geräte, Leitern und viele, viele andere Dinge. Bauwerke haben eine Mechanik, zusammenzubrechen, wenn das Fundament zerstört wird. Daher ist es wichtig, deine Gebäude zu verstärken. Alle Bauwerke und Items können bemalt werden, um das Design deines Hauses an deine Wünsche anzupassen und dynamische, per-pixel bemalbare Schilder, Aushängeschilder und andere dekorative Objekte ganz nach deinen Wünschen einzufärben. Häuser reduzieren die extreme des Wetters und bieten dir und deinem Vorrat Schutz. Waffen, Kleidung und Rüstungen können ebenfalls eingefärbt werden um deinem persönlichen Stil zu entsprechen. <br><br>PFLANZEN, ABBAUEN UND KULTIVIEREN<br><br>Wähle Samen aus der wilden Vegetation um dich herum, pflanze sie in Beete die du platzierst, wässere sie und dünge sie mit Dünger (Alles hinterlässt Fäkalien nachdem Kalorien konsumiert wurden, welche kompostiert werden können. Manche Dünger sind besser als andere). Achte auf deine Pflänzchen und sie werden wachsen und köstliche und seltene Früchte hervorbringen, welche ebenfalls zum kochen einer breiten varietät an logischen Rezepten und Tränken genutzt werden können. Erkunde die Insel um weitere, seltene Samen mit nützlichen Eigenschaften zu finden! Vegetarier und Veganer werden aufblühen und es wird möglich sein, ARK ohne Gewalt zu erobern! <br><br>BESCHWÖRE DIE ULTIMATIVEN LEBENSFORMEN<br><br>Indem du sehr seltene Opfergaben an spezielle Beschwörungsorte bringst, kannst du dir die Aufmerksamkeit einer der gottgleichen, mythologischen Kreaturen in ARK sichern, welche anschließend zum Kampf erscheint. Diese gigantischen Monstrositäten bieten ein End-Game-Ziel für die erfahrensten Gruppen an Spielern und Ihrer Armee an Hausdinos und werden eine extrem wertvolle Ausbeute an Items bieten, wenn man überhaupt schafft, sie zu besiegen. <br><br>STAMM-SYSTEM<br><br>Erstelle einen Stamm und füge deine Freunde hinzu. Alle deine Hausdinos können von einem Verbündeten befohlen werden. Dein Stamm wird außerdem die Möglichkeit haben, an jedem deiner Heimat-Spawnpunkte zu respawnen. Befördere Mitglieder zu Stammführern um das Management zu erleichtern. Verteile Schlüssel-Items und Zugangscodes um den Zugang zu deinem Dorf zu bieten! <br><br>RPG-STATISTIKEN<br><br>Alle Gegenstände werden mithilfe von Blaupausen hergestellt, die verschiedene Statistiken und Qualitäten besitzen und für die Herstellung dementsprechende Ressourcen benötigen. Abgelegenere und schwer zu erreichende Orte quer über die Ark, bieten meist bessere Materialien, eingeschlossen der höchsten Berge, dunkelsten Höhlen und größten tiefen des Ozeans! Level deinen Charakter indem du Erfahrungspunkte sammelst, level deine Tiere und lerne neue &quot;Engramme&quot; um in der Lage zu sein, Gegenstände frei aus dem Gedächtnis herzustellen, ohne das Blaupausen dafür nötig wären, selbst wenn du stirbst! Passe das Aussehen deines Charakters an, indem du Haare, Augen, Hautfarben, sowie einer Reihe von Körperproportionen veränderst. <br><br>HARDCORE-MECHANIKEN<br><br>Jeder Gegenstand, den du baust, hat eine gewisse Haltbarkeit und wird kaputtgehen, wenn du diesen zu sehr benutzt und nicht reparierst. Wenn du das Spiel verlässt, verbleibt dein Charakter schlafend in der virtuellen Welt. Dein Inventar ist in Boxen im Charakter unterteilt. Alles kann gelooted oder geklaut werden, daher musst du für deine Sicherheit sorgen indem du Baust, dich mit anderen Spielern verbündest oder dir Dinos als Wächter zähmst. Der Tod ist permanent und du kannst andere Spieler sogar bewusstlos schlagen, fangen und ihnen Nahrung aufzwingen um sie deinem Willen zu beugen, ihnen Blut für eine eigene Transfusion abzuzapfen oder ihre Fäkalien aufsammeln um diese zu Dünger zu verarbeiten. Oder du benutzt sie als Futter für deine fleischfressenden Freunde! <br><br>ERKUNDE UND ENTDECKE<br><br>Die mysteriöse ARK ist eine beeindruckende und imposante Umgebung, bestehend aus natürlichen- und unnatürlichen Strukturen überhalb oder unterhalb der Erde und ebenso unterwasser. Während du die Geheimnisse der Insel erkundest, wirst du viele, zufällig generierte Kreaturen und seltene Blaupausen finden. Auch kannst du Erkundungsnotizen finden, die dynamisch in das Spiel gebracht werden, geschrieben und wunderschön verziert vor Jahrtausenden von vorherigen Einwohnern der ARK. Auf kreative Art stellen diese die Kreaturen und die Hintergrundgeschichte der ARK dar. Decke die gesamte Karte durch Erkundungen auf, markiere besonders interessante Punkte und baue dir einen Kompass oder ein GPS-System um das Erkunden mit anderen Spielern, mit denen du per Sprache, Text oder Langstrecken-Telefone kommunizieren kannst, zu vereinfachen. Baue und zeichne Schilder für andere Spieler um ihnen zu helfen oder sie vom Weg abzubringen... Dennoch... Wie wirst du die Schöpfer herausfordern, um die ARK zu erobern? Ein definitives Eng-Game ist in Planung. <br><br>RIESIGE WELTBESTÄNDIGKEIT UND META-UNIVERSUM<br><br>Auf den 100+ Spieler-Servern werden dein Charakter, deine Gebäude und deine Hausdinos im Spiel bleiben, selbst wenn du das Spiel verlässt. Du kannst deinen Charakter sogar im Netzwerk der ARK's verschieben, indem du zu einem Obelisk gehst und deine Daten in der Steam Economy hoch- oder herunterlädst. Eine Galaxie voller ARK's, jede anders als die andere, wartet darauf, von dir erobert und verändert zu werden, eine nach der anderen -- Spezielle, offizielle ARK's werden auf der Weltkarte für kurze Zeit und für spezielle Events enthüllt werden! <br><br>STABILER STEAM-WORKSHOP MOD-SUPPORT<br><br>Du kannst alleine und lokal im Einzelspieler-Modus spielen und deinen Charakter und deine Items zwischen inoffiziellen, gehosteten Servern vor- und zurück vom Einzel- zum Mehrspielermodus transferieren. Modifiziere das Spiel mit vollem Steam Workshop-Support und dem angepassten Unreal Engine 4 Editor. Finde heraus, wie wir unsere ARK mit unseren Karten und Werten als Beispiel erstellt haben. Hoste deinen eigenen Server und konfiguriere deine ARK präzise und an deine Wünsche angepasst. Wir sollen sehen, was du kreierst!<br><br>BEEINDRUCKENDE GRAFIKEN DER NÄCHSTEN GENERATION<br><br>Die erstklassige, hyperreale Bilddarstellung der Kreaturen in ARK wird durch eine extrem angepasste Unreal Engine 4 erreicht, die dynamische Lichtverhältnisse, globale Beleuchtung, Wettersysteme (Regen, Nebel, Schnee, etc.) und eine lebensechte Wolkensimulation, dank der neuesten Rendertechnik von DirectX11 und DirectX12, möglich macht. Die Musik stammt aus der Feder des preisgekrönten Komponisten von &quot;Ori and the Blind Forest&quot;, Gareth Coker!",

We ultimately chose to make the game free-to-play from the beginning in order to allow any curious player to try it without having to plunk down hard earned cash given how questionable early access titles can sometimes be. This free to play model worked for quite some time due to word of mouth, almost 2 years in fact, however, with the population dwindling we fear that we cannot keep servers online for much longer. <br><br>Not long ago we made the decision to restrict new user registrations as well as halt the sale of in game currency to avoid potential disappointment from new players as the game had not been updated in the last 4 months. Unfortunately the economics of the game are not able to afford us the luxury of continued development and support for Aftermath. With sadness we’ve made the difficult decision to close Aftermath. It wasn’t an easy decision for us, as we’ve been quite emotionally invested in Aftermath, but sometimes these kind of decisions have to made in order to move forward as a company.<br><br>We as a team would like to thank you for all of the support you have given us over the past 2 years and the fun experiences we were all able to share - be it fighting over supply drops, herding zombies for liberation events, collecting resources, crafting, building forts and more.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>Survive against the odds in a giant sandbox MMO world featuring lush forests, dry desert plains, peaceful meadows and the eerie zombies that inhabit the world. <br><br>Scavenge for guns, supplies, survival items and crafting materials in various zones including cities, farms, military bases, abandoned outposts, forgotten rest stops and hundreds of small encampments left behind by survivors before you.  <br><br>Build and protect your shelter, harvest crops, learn crafting blueprints and store your items on our server in your Global Inventory or hide them in a stash box in the world.  <br><br>Be a civilian, a trader, a protector of peace, a ruthless bandit or combination of them all.  Customize your character with hundreds of visual cosmetic items including Headwear, Facewear, Shirts, Jackets and Pants.  Swap your cosmetic items at any time on the fly, unlock weapon skins and show everyone in a safezone that you know where to find the rare items.  <br><br><strong>THE FOLLOWING FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW<\/strong> :<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gun Skins<\/h2><br>Unlock permanent skins for your guns via special Cosmetic Crates that can be found in the world.

There are even rare permanently skinned guns rumored to be available to those who hunt far and wide.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crafting<\/h2><br>Fill in the gaps during your looting adventure by crafting useful things you couldn't find.  Break down rubbish items in the world into their core crafting components and repurpose them into high end upgrades to your gear or fashion a new silencer for your gun.  With over 40+ crafting recipes to be unlocked you'll find that almost anything you need can be crafted, provided you've found the right components.  Loot or craft all the items a survivor would need in a zombie apocalypse as well as a few novelty and lethal crafting options that may be above and beyond the usual survival requirements.  Craft shelter, weapons, attachments, armor, ammunition, medical supplies, food, purify water and set up traps for players or set up a nice peaceful garden to harvest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Town Liberation<\/h2><br>You've looted the city and killed the zombies, but what should you do next?  Liberate the town of course!  Now players have the option to repair generators and fill them with gasoline from a nearby gas pump.  Once all the generators are repaired and enough zombies have been killed then supply drops with epic loots will begin dropping all around the town!  Beware though, other survivors will likely be wanting the supply drops as well.  It is up to you to decide if you share the spoils.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Supply Drops<\/h2><br>Supply shipments containing large caches of weapons, ammo, medical supplies and rare guns have been spotted randomly on the map.  Be lucky enough to find one of these alone and you'll walk away armed to the teeth with enough gear to arm your friends as well!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Radio Tower Control<\/h2><br>Disable zombie sense of smell, sight and sound for a short period of time in key areas to move unhindered and unnoticed by the local zombies.  Find a radio transmission chip and insert it into the console at a functioning radio town in a town to take advantage of this new gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hundreds of Character Customizations variants<\/h2><br>Customize your character at any time in game simply by opening the customization menu.  Change out your hat, mask or scarf, upper body and legware to match your surroundings.  Don't stick out like a sore thumb in the middle of the jungle with a desert camo outfit.  Adapt your clothing to fit to your surroundings without taking up bagspace.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Place-able Barricades<\/h2><br>Find fortification in any situation with placeable barricades.  Available both through looting as well as crafting - these essential placable barricades can be the difference between life and death by blocking damage and visibility between you and another survivor attempting to shoot you.  With 7 different barricades to choose from you'll have one for every situation including cleverly placed barricades to enable access to an area not normally accessible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Base Building<\/h2><br>Ever dreamed of owning a little piece of land overlooking your favorite location in a game?  Now you can with our totally renovated base building system!  Place down your statue to claim your land and build unhindered anywhere on the land that you own.  Place defenses, harvestable crops, cooking racks, water wells, living quarters for your friends and your own personal storage locker!  Owning a base has never been better!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grouping<\/h2><br>Group with your friends or even make new friends with other players in game.  You can't be back stabbed while in a group so feel free to team up with anyone!  Beware they might lead you to some of their not so friendly &quot;friends&quot; but that's all part of the adventure.  Take on challenges like the new Town Liberation's or raid an enemy base in style in all matching cosmetic outfits!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stat Tracking<\/h2><br>We now make it easy for you to track your stats in game like time played as well as kills and deaths simply by typing <strong>\/stats <\/strong>in game chat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Harvestable Crops<\/h2><br>Live off the land and prosper by hiding gardens around the land for your own personal food stash or protect them inside your base.  Once food has been harvested you can choose to eat it on the spot, cook it or use it in a crafting recipe to possibly get even better results.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Variety of  Guns<\/h2><br>Want to play a game where you don't have all the best items the very first hour you play?  We have variety of weapons to find right now.  We have items ranging from crafted and assembled homebrew weapons as well as high grade factory weapons including rare collectors edition versions of guns and different tiers of weapons featuring different recoil, spread and damage ratios.  The rarer the gun, the better the gun.  Show off your guns and skins in a safezone or trade with other players!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Melee Weapons<\/h2><br>As much as everyone always wants to be armed to the teeth with the best assault rifle, everyone has to start somewhere and sometimes the best you've got is a kitchen knife.  We've got you covered from simple household weapons to crafted makeshift weapons as well as heavier duty fire axes and maces that deal brutal damage but swing slow.  We're sure you'll be able to find your niche weapon for beating off zombies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PVP Servers<\/h2><br>Up the anty with a bit of extra excitement in your zombie apocalypse.  Head into a PVP server where it's no holds barred item drop PVP and test your mettle against other survivors if you happen to cross paths.  Town Liberations are enabled on PVP servers to add a bit more risk to the reward of open world &quot;anything goes&quot; pvp.  Find unique solutions to player disputes on PVP servers not normally possible on PVE.  Expect players to be ruthless.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PVE Servers<\/h2><br>Tired of always feeling like everyone is out to get you for all your precious items and every shadow and sound is terrifying?  We understand that you might feel more like going on an adventure and turning up the ambiance without the constant fear of someone stalking you.  PVE offers a more casual experience for players that just want to practice surviving and looting in the world without PVP combat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Totally new respawn system<\/h2><br>Now featuring five new respawn options so players really have control over where they are in the world.  Upon your unfortunate death you can now choose between proximity, sleeping bag, base, group or safezone now.  This really helps players meet up with their friends across the map quicker by taking a quick and dirty respawn or allows you the convenience of being across the map and still returning back to your base in a pinch, provided you're okay with dying :)",

Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. <br><br>There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Massive Prehistoric Multiplayer<\/strong><\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/376210\/extras\/Underline.png?t=1653237914\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/376210\/extras\/StoreImageDanger.jpg?t=1653237914\" \/><br>Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature.<br><br>Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs\/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Survival or Sandbox?<\/strong><\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/376210\/extras\/Underline.png?t=1653237914\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/376210\/extras\/StoreImageFuture.jpg?t=1653237914\" \/><br>The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/376210\/extras\/StoreImageSandbox.jpg?t=1653237914\" \/><br>However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Global Community Story<\/strong><\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/376210\/extras\/Underline.png?t=1653237914\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/376210\/extras\/StoreImageStory.jpg?t=1653237914\" \/><br>The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? <br><br>It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Future Development Goals<\/strong><\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/376210\/extras\/Underline.png?t=1653237914\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/376210\/extras\/pteranodon_promo_2.jpg?t=1653237914\" \/><br>We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Playable aquatic and aerial creatures<br><\/li><li>Even more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles<br><\/li><li>Two new playable factions: modern humans &amp; the indigenous<br><\/li><li>Evolve into advanced &quot;strain&quot; versions of certain dinosaurs<br><\/li><li>Realistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours<br><\/li><li>Additional world biome types such as thick jungles<br><\/li><li>Dynamic aerial drop-in spawn system<br><\/li><li>Global in-game world quest<br><\/li><li>Localization of all in-game menus &amp; text<br><\/li><li>Better accessibility &amp; customization options<br><\/li><li>Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes<br><\/li><li>Mod support using Steam Workshop<\/li><\/ul><br>All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. <br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/376210\/extras\/Underline.png?t=1653237914\" \/><br><i>--AE Core TX Received--<br>--End Promotional Protocol--<\/i><br><br><i>--SiGnaL InTeRrUpt--<br>-tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev<\/i>-",

The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.<br> <br>The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play.<br><br>More information about the game is available at <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.deadbydaylight.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >http:\/\/www.deadbydaylight.com<\/a><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features<\/h2>•\t<strong>Survive Together… Or Not<\/strong> - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?<br><br>•\t<strong>Where Am I?<\/strong> - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play.<br><br>•\t<strong>A Feast for Killers<\/strong> - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/381210\/extras\/DBD_HillB_Trapper_Wraith_anime_Steam.jpg?t=1690301262\" \/><br><br>•\t<strong>Deeper and Deeper<\/strong> - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.<br><br>•\t<strong>Real People, Real Fear<\/strong> - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog.<br><br><br><strong>WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY\/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYING<\/strong><br><br><i>A very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns.

Thousands of ships and stations trade, mine and produce, all realistically simulated. In this universe, you can grow from being the lone pilot of a fighter ship, to managing a vast empire, commanding your fleets and designing colossal space stations. Transition seamlessly from first-person action, boarding ships and visiting their bridges, to an expansive strategy and management simulation. Choose your own path at your own pace. The decisions are yours. Trade - Fight - Build - Think.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/392160\/extras\/x4-steam2023-1.gif?t=1690201102\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Start your journey<\/h2>In X4, you can start your journey from <strong>a number of different gamestarts<\/strong> and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always <strong>free to develop in any other direction<\/strong>.

From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a <strong>seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships<\/strong>. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/392160\/extras\/x4-steam2023-building.gif?t=1690201102\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build space stations and upgrade your ships<\/h2>Building space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to <strong>establish their own economy<\/strong> and <strong>start influencing the universe on a larger scale<\/strong>. In X4, it is now possible to be completely <strong>free and creative<\/strong>. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The <strong>powerful new map system<\/strong> allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experience the most dynamic X universe ever<\/h2>X4 is the first X game to allow our races and factions to <strong>freely build and expand their empires<\/strong>; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can <strong>influence the course of the entire universe<\/strong>.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/392160\/extras\/x4-steam2023-map.gif?t=1690201102\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage your empire with a powerful map<\/h2>Once you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dive into the most detailed X economy ever<\/h2>One of the key selling points of X games has always been the<strong> realistic, simulated economy<\/strong>. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game,<strong> all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources<\/strong>. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Research and teleport<\/h2>The seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: <strong>Teleportation<\/strong>. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.",

Will you choose to play as Empress Emily Kaldwin or the royal protector, Corvo Attano? Will you make your way through the game unseen, make full use of its brutal combat system, or use a blend of both? How will you combine your character's unique set of powers, weapons and gadgets to eliminate your enemies? The story responds to your choices, leading to intriguing outcomes, as you play through each of the game's hand-crafted missions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story<\/h2>Dishonored 2 is set 15 years after the Lord Regent has been vanquished and the dreaded Rat Plague has passed into history. An otherworldly usurper has seized Empress Emily Kaldwin’s throne, leaving the fate of the Isles hanging in the balance. As Emily or Corvo, travel beyond the legendary streets of Dunwall to Karnaca, the once-dazzling coastal city that holds the keys to restoring Emily to power. Armed with the Mark of the Outsider and powerful new abilities, track down your enemies and take back what’s rightfully yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Assassins <\/h2>As fully voiced characters, Emily Kaldwin and Corvo Attano now bring their own perspectives and emotional responses to the world and story. Use each character’s set of powers, gadgets and uniquely-tuned weapons in creative ways as you explore the world – whether you fight your way through the city streets or sneak across the rooftops - and which enemies you decide to eliminate or spare. <br><br><\/li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Supernatural Powers<\/h2>Advanced bonecharm crafting and all-new upgrade trees allow you to customize your powers in vastly different ways. Become a living shadow to silently stalk your targets, link enemies so they share a common fate, or mesmerize your foes and dominate their minds. Choose from nearly infinite combinations of violence, nonlethal combat, powers and weapons to accomplish your objectives.<br><br><\/li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Imaginative World \t<\/h2>From the grimy, rat-infested streets of Dunwall to the lush, exotic coasts of a decaying Karnaca, immerse yourself in stylized locales created by Arkane’s premiere art and narrative teams. The world is a character in its own right, rich with story, architecture and eclectic characters. It is also punctuated by signature mission locations, such as the Dust District, ravaged by dust storms and warring factions, and a madman’s mansion made of shifting walls, deadly traps and clockwork soldiers. <br><br><\/li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Void Engine<\/h2>Dishonored 2 is beautifully brought to life with the new Void Engine, a leap forward in rendering technology, built from id Tech and highly-customized by Arkane Studios.

When the battle begins, they’ll fly towards an island aboard a giant Quetzal before ejecting and gliding towards their chosen starting area. Do competitors dash for drops and fight it out? Do they run into the jungle and hide, search for creatures to tame, and rapidly build their Dino Army, or do they die to a pack of curious Compys? Make use of the birds-eye-view mode, which allows you more effectively Command-&amp;-Control your army of dinosaurs, directly possess individual upgradeable creatures, and issue commands to your team as the ultimate strategist. This unique RTS-style experience is available in-life and also after-death! Avoid the continually shrinking and dynamic “ring of death” that forces contestants ever closer together over time and become the last tribe standing. The hunt is on!<br><br>Please note: this version is currently only a prototype to test out the new gameplay and features – it is not yet a fully-featured competitive game.

In the years since <i>Orcs Must Die! 2<\/i>, Maximillian and Gabriella have done their best to rebuild the once-mighty Order.

        "detailed_description":"Battle Royale is back! The game that took the world by storm in 2016 has returned to its roots and is better than ever, not to mention free-to-play. With a whole host of improvements and new features, The Culling: Origins takes you back to the island where it all began... and asks whether you have the guts, brains, and skill required to survive.<br> <br> <br>Welcome to The Culling. As a contestant on this deadly game show you must explore, scavenge items, craft weapons, and build traps that will enable you to slay your fellow contestants and emerge victorious before the end of the round. Only with cunning, skill, and a little luck will you be able to prevail and survive the match.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How we do free-to-play<\/h2>All aspects of gameplay are available to all players and The Culling does not (and will never) include pay-to-win mechanics.<br> <br> <br>If you choose to spend real money, you can do so through paid DLC packs or premium currency in the form of Tokens. Tokens allow you to buy Cull Crates and exclusive Premium Items. You can earn Cull Crates, which award standard cosmetic items, by simply playing the game. All of these unlocks are cosmetic and have no impact on gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How we develop The Culling<\/h2>We are committed to ongoing, community-focused development. Our goal is to provide a game that is as optimized, bug-free, and safe from cheaters as possible. Beyond that, we are balancing the game and adding new features based on input and requests directly from the community. If you'd like to get in on the action and share your ideas and opinions, please visit our website for more details.<br><br><br><br><strong>Features<\/strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Modes<\/h2>The core of The Culling is an online 16-player battle royale, played solo or in teams of two. Matches last approximately 20 minutes, with deadly poison gas slowly constricting the arena in the final stages. The winning player (or team) is the last left alive.<br> <br> <br>With no respawning on death, you have to make every action count. Play too cautiously and you won’t be prepared for the final clash at the end of the match, too aggressively and you might not make it past the first few minutes. It takes the right mix of skill and strategy to survive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Custom Matches<\/h2>Keep your friends close and your enemies closer as you orchestrate your own private matches of up to 16 players. Your competition, your rules, your Culling.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapons and Combat<\/h2>The Culling focuses heavily on melee combat. Use jabs, charged swings, blocks, and shoves in a system that’s simple learn, but requires practice to truly master.<br> <br> <br>There are dozens of melee weapons in the form of blades, axes, bludgeons, and spears. Weapons are divided into tiers based on damage, from the lowly crafted stone knife to the mighty Sledgehammer. Different weapons types also apply different wounds, which factor into combat strategy. All melee weapons can be thrown, adding the potential for ranged combat in any encounter.<br> <br>There are a variety of ranged weapons, including bows, blowguns, and even firearms. A gun isn’t a guaranteed kill, however, as ammunition is in short supply and ranged players can be disarmed by melee strikes if they don’t keep their distance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Traps<\/h2>Players who thrive on outwitting their enemies can sample from a collection of traps in the form of snares, mines, remote-detonated explosives, caltrops, and punji sticks. Matches are fast-paced, so sneaky players must lay their traps in hot spots (such as near an airdrop landing pad) or use themselves as bait to lure opponents in.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Items<\/h2>A wide range of utility items are at your disposal, with everything from backpacks to smoke bombs, run speed stims to stun guns, player tracking devices to bandages. You start each match empty-handed, so you must explore to survive. Inventory space is extremely limited, forcing you to think carefully about how you intend to play and what you want to carry.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crafting<\/h2>The Culling utilizes a unique crafting system that is very simple to use (no bulky UI-heavy inventory management) but still offers a wide range of recipes. Players can craft rudimentary weapons, a wide range of traps, and a handful of useful items, including bandages, satchels, and even body armor.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Perks<\/h2>Each contestant chooses 3 perks before the start of a match. There are dozens of perks available, and they range from combat bonuses (increase the backstab potential of your blades) to crafting skills (reduce your trap placement time), to general utility (begin the match with a tracking device in your inventory).<br> <br> <br>All of the perks are available to all players from the start with no unlocking required. You can use perks to define and enhance your personal play style, whether it be focused on ranged, melee, or trap-based strategy. Advanced players will find helpful synergies between their perk load-out and their airdrop selection.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Airdrops<\/h2>Players select a personal airdrop to call in during the match. Air drops are deadly care packages containing a predefined variety of weapons, traps and items. Be careful, because calling in an airdrop draws attention to you and can be stolen by other players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Show Events<\/h2>The Culling is the most popular game show in the history of the world, and for good reason. The show’s producers have devised events that take place at random during the match. If you choose to participate in these events, the rewards can improve your chances of winning, but don’t be surprised when other players arrive to challenge you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FUNC<\/h2>Flexible Universal Nano-Compound, or FUNC, serves as the primary in-game currency. You spend FUNC to craft, call in personal airdrops, and open certain types of item chests. FUNC is gained through combat and exploration.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Character Customization<\/h2>Players can customize every aspect of their appearance: Hair, Clothing, Skin Tone, and Gender. There are hundreds of unlockable items.<br> <br> <br>The Culling also features customizable Taunts, Victory Celebrations, Culling Cards, and Weapon Skins.<br>In all, there are over 1,500 cosmetics to unlock.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Audio<\/h2>The Culling places a heavy gameplay emphasis on audio. Making noise by sprinting through the jungle crafting items, slamming doors, and engaging in combat will draw the attention of nearby contestants.<br> <br> <br>Using audio cues to locate opponents and using the crouch mode to conceal your movements add tremendously to the game’s suspense and immersion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tutorials and Offline Training Mode<\/h2>The Culling can be intimidating for new players, so we’ve included a basic tutorial and a training range to help you get your feet wet.<br> <br> <br>If you’re still not ready to face players online, there is an offline practice mode against basic AI-controlled bots that will allow you to practice in a low-pressure situation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Player XP and Leveling<\/h2>As you compete online in The Culling, you earn XP, which levels up your character and awards you Cull Crates full of new cosmetics. The better your performance, the faster you progress.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Leaderboards<\/h2>The Culling features seasonal leaderboards, which showcase players with the most wins, most kills, and best ranking. Ranking is determined by an aggregate of your 10 best match scores for the season. Leaderboards are regional and split between Solo and Duo modes.",

Japan's #1 strategic card game.<br \/>\r\nMade by card gamers for card gamers. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShadowverse is Japan's #1 strategic card game!<br \/>\r\n- There are millions of Shadowverse battles every day, and a multitude of ways to play<br \/>\r\n- Easy to get into, thanks to a singleplayer story mode, free card packs for new players, and bonuses every day <br \/>\r\n- Battles are finely balanced, with less RNG than other card games, and balance adjustments take place every month<br \/>\r\n- New card expansions are released every three months, unleashing new deck-building strategies and battle tactics<br \/>\r\n- We’ve got a great community of 22 million players and counting, with tournaments and esports broadcasts every week and support for streamers <br \/>\r\n- Featuring beautiful art and animations and fully voiced cards and story<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- A multitude of ways to play: <br \/>\r\nWith eight different leader classes, Shadowverse gives you unparalleled freedom to create your own deck strategies. Will you play as Urias and unleash your Vengeance when your health is depleted? Or will you select Isabelle, whose spells power up the cards in your hand? Will you go all in with an aggro deck, or try to contain the board with a control deck? Or will you try to sneak in some sublimely ingenious combos? It’s entirely up to you. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Easy to get into: <br \/>\r\nLearn the basics by playing through our extensive singleplayer story mode before taking on other players in our multiplayer modes. Be sure to pick up your free card packs after you’ve finished playing through the tutorial – just go to your Crate from the main menu to pick them up. And bonuses and daily missions help you unlock new card packs every day so it won’t be long before you have a deck that is capable of competing with the very best. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Finely balanced: <br \/>\r\nThere’s less RNG in Shadowverse than other card games, making it supremely balanced: you’ll need to trust your judgement not your luck if you are to come out on top. And we make balance adjustments every month to make sure that no one card or deck type becomes too dominant.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- New card expansions released regularly: <br \/>\r\nNew card expansions are added every three months to make sure the meta never gets stale. And every single expansion unleashes new deck-building strategies and battle tactics, and even new leader classes and game modes. We’re in this for the long haul and we hope you will be too.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Beautiful art:<br \/>\r\nAll of the cards in Shadowverse feature fantastic art by some of Japan’s finest artists, and every single card is available as an animated version. Every card is also fully-voiced, in English and Japanese, as is the singleplayer storyline. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- A great community:<br \/>\r\nAnd last but not least, we have some amazing fans. We’ve got memes, we’ve got streams, and we have much, much more to offer than the average card game. Community tournaments and e-sports broadcasts take place every week, and there are a ton of deck-building resources online in case you get stuck. Millions of card gamers can’t be wrong – why don’t you join them?",

The Rundown is a series of expeditions, each one taking you deeper into a decayed research facility called The Complex. You descend level by level, scavenging tools and resources that help you survive in a perilous network of tunnels where gruesome creatures lurk in every shadow. Complete all the expeditions to fulfill the Work Order and clear the Rundown.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/493520\/extras\/00_WARNING.png?t=1688026288\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/493520\/extras\/01_COOP.png?t=1688026288\" \/> <br>GTFO is designed for prisoner teams of four, putting cooperation at the core of the experience. Bots can fill your lineup if you’re short one or two players. They’ll follow you through expeditions, sneak when you sneak, collect resources, and fight alongside you. They’re a good fallback, but the level of communication and tactical combat in GTFO means it’s best to play with people.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/493520\/extras\/02_PREPARE.png?t=1688026288\" \/><br>A strategy is necessary to clear the Rundown. Before you drop into The Complex, your team needs to decide what gear, boosters, and weapons to bring. You must also balance the team, identifying the function of each prisoner so that you know what to do when things go wrong. And they will. They always do.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/493520\/extras\/03_SLEEPER.png?t=1688026288\" \/><br>Stealth and coordination are necessary to survive as you maneuver through The Complex. Many of the creatures of GTFO are suspended in a state of hibernation, so light, noise, and vibrations can easily wake up these Sleepers. And if one of them knows you’re there, they all know. That’s when things get messy.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/493520\/extras\/04_FIGHT.png?t=1688026288\" \/><br>You’ll need heavy weaponry and a clear mind when the shit hits the fan. Check your line of fire, force them through bottlenecks, set up your kill zones and reload every chance you get. These creatures stop at nothing, and neither should you. Once the mayhem starts, you have no choice but to put every last one of them down.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/493520\/extras\/02_steam.gif?t=1688026288\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/493520\/extras\/05_SCARS.png?t=1688026288\" \/><br>Clearing expeditions and Rundowns will reward you with new cosmetic gear. Wear it with pride, as it proves to your peers you’ve been to hell and back. The Sleepers, on the other hand, will not care for a second.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/493520\/extras\/06_CONNECT.png?t=1688026288\" \/>",

You choose how you’ll deal with other people who move into your town. Will you be friendly and welcoming... or will you aggressively defend your territory?<br><br>Every player’s experience in the sandbox is unique. Each character in your community has their own special set of skills and traits, so no two communities are ever the same. The challenges you face also vary from game to game, based on who you recruit and the decisions you make along the way.<br><br>With co-op multiplayer support, you can visit your friends' communities and help them through a tough spot, bringing back rewards for your own communities later.

The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. <br><br>You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/534380\/extras\/dl_2_sh_steam.gif?t=1690383938\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE<\/h2>Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE DEAD<\/h2>Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE<\/h2>Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT<\/h2>In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE<\/h2>Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/534380\/extras\/steam_footer_dying_light2.jpg?t=1690383938\" \/>",

Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/569480\/extras\/cd.png?t=1686933738\" \/><br>Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/569480\/extras\/banner_city.jpg?t=1686933738\" \/><br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/569480\/extras\/rect7730-4-ff2.png?t=1686933738\" \/><br>The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/569480\/extras\/banner_castle.jpg?t=1686933738\" \/><br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/569480\/extras\/text4275-2-6.png?t=1686933738\" \/><br>And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter.  A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/569480\/extras\/banner_world.jpg?t=1686933738\" \/><br><br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/569480\/extras\/Funded_with_Fig_Logo_v01_Large.png?t=1686933738\" \/><br>Kingdoms and Castles is the first Fig funded game to be released.

If you're not sure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods.

Whether you’re jumping out of a plane, arriving in a landing craft by sea, resupplying friendlies or operating a tank, you will find multiple reasons to drop back into the battlefield in this grand scaled representation of a WW2 setting never explored in a large multiplayer environment.<br><br>Post Scriptum will cover multiple theatres in the form of chapters, with the 1st Chapter “The Bloody Seventh” being the original setting in Operation Market Garden, it covers the 1st Airborne, 82nd and 101st Airborne, the 9th Waffen SS and the Wehrmacht, with over 40 vehicles, 9 maps. The 2nd Chapter “Plan Jaune” covers the Invasion of France in 1940 and features the French Army as well as the Wehrmacht of 1940, dozens of new vehicles, 2 new maps with a 3rd still coming. The 3rd Chapter &quot;Day of Days&quot; which will cover the Invasion of Normandy in 1944, features new factions like the German Fallschirmjägers and US 4th Infantry, each with new vehicles and a few new weapons, and with 2 new maps and a 3rd coming later, which adds to the already large selections of maps.

Our game is similar to other mod-friendly games like Ravenfield and Garry's Mod but with roots in military simulation games like Squad and Arma III. This means while the base un-modified game will play more like Squad or Insurgency: Sandstorm, modified versions of the game can be like anything else you can imagine.<br><br><i>Defending against an alien invasion in the &quot;Troopers&quot; mod for Operation: Harsh Doorstop.<\/i><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/736590\/extras\/ezgif-4-3e4ecfab76.gif?t=1680146085\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How much does Operation: Harsh Doorstop cost?<\/h2><br>Operation: Harsh Doorstop is a free game. Our community members can donate to help fund development, but we still believe in making our game freely accessible to everyone. Not only is this important to us as a statement against corporate greed, but we also feel that game communities are healthier (and larger) when games are more accessible.<br><br><i>A full squad assaults a flag while playing &quot;Khafji&quot; in Operation: Harsh Doorstop.<\/i><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/736590\/extras\/ezgif-2-9d0bd6edc3.gif?t=1680146085\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Is this game a tactical shooter?<\/h2><br>Operation: Harsh Doorstop has strong roots in tactical shooter games such as Project Reality, Squad, and Red Orchestra (including multiple developers from those projects who have also worked on this game) however Operation: Harsh Doorstop has a much stronger emphasis on mod-ability and flexibility (similar to games such as Arma.) Ultimately we encourage everyone to play the game as you'd prefer to play it, and we intend to continue implementing additional parameters that allow players to customize their experience to their own liking.<br><br><i>Assaulting the urban district while playing &quot;Khafji&quot; in Operation: Harsh Doorstop.<\/i><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/736590\/extras\/ezgif-2-52c928e420.gif?t=1680146085\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">When will Operation: Harsh Doorstop be finished?<\/h2><br>As long as the community continues to donate and support our development, Operation: Harsh Doorstop will be continually updated. Moreover, we have built Operation: Harsh Doorstop in such a way that even if development ceases at any point, the community could continue developing it independently through Steam Workshop. The goal is to create a game that lasts forever.<br><br><i>A heavy machine gunner laying down fire in Operation: Harsh Doorstop.<\/i><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/736590\/extras\/ezgif-2-4648315ac4.gif?t=1680146085\" \/><br><br>Thank you so much for following our project, and we hope to see you on the battlefield soon.",

Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls &quot;Mr. Riggs&quot;, can withstand the harshest environmental conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BASE BUILDING<\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/780310\/extras\/release_base_building.gif?t=1687786310\" \/><br>Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants and research facilities to complete this mission.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEFENSE<\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/780310\/extras\/riftbreaker_basedefense.gif?t=1687786310\" \/><br>Your presence on this planet will not go unnoticed.

The main sources of inspiration are Zelda, Metroid and Portal.<\/strong><br>Supraland assumes that you are intelligent and lets you play independently.

A cornerstone of Supraland's design was to create abilities that are so versatile, they will keep on surprising you by how many different usages they have. If you combine your abilities, the possibilities become even bigger.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/813630\/extras\/pacing.png?t=1684450200\" \/><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/813630\/extras\/Exploration.png?t=1684450200\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/813630\/extras\/Headershot1.png?t=1684450200\" \/><br>Most of the game is about exploring the sandbox world to track down secrets.

And it's important to me that once you understand the idea behind a puzzle, you can pretty much immediately solve it instead of having to go through a cumbersome, frustrating execution.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/813630\/extras\/Combat.png?t=1684450200\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/813630\/extras\/SupralandFighting500.gif?t=1684450200\" \/><br>The fighting mechanics are inspired by old-school, fast-paced shooter games like Unreal, Doom and Quake, encouraging high-speed strafing and jumping while throwing shot after shot at hordes of charging enemies without ever having to worry about weapons reloading.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/813630\/extras\/FreeDemo.png?t=1684450200\" \/><br>In the demo you can play the first big section of the game and decide if it's for you.

Wage war against enemy fleets while you single-handedly command large ships of war -- or divide the responsibilities among your trusted shipmates instead. Dive into the watery depths to explore sunken shipwrecks. Team up with other explorers to discover new lands rich with resources, exotic creatures, and ruins of a bygone time. Become a pirate legend in this ultimate quest for fortune and glory!<br><br><strong>Create the Pirate Ship of Your Dreams<\/strong><br><br>From tiny rafts and dinghies to colossal frigates and galleons, your dream vessel is only a shipyard away with our robust ship customization system.

This is also where higher level missions happen, which include calling a giant laser drill for big profit and, for the dungeon-delvers among you, exploring the Crusher Caverns. <br><br>Tharis Island is the newest map introduced with Season 2. It’s a small remote island host to labyrinthian cave systems, full of secrets, highly valuable materials and, of course, highly dangerous wildlife. Expeditions to the island are no walk in the park and players will have to gain experience first and unlock access through the faction campaigns. The depths of Tharis Island offer the most tense and challenging version of The Cycle: Frontier yet – the highest risks for the highest rewards! <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/868270\/extras\/TCF_GIF_03.gif?t=1687936053\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PROSPECTING ISN'T EVERYTHING<\/h2>Whether in an escape shuttle with a backpack full of riches or covered in foam and bare of your belongings, each trip to the surface will see you back home – Prospect Station. This is where all that precious loot can be put to good use: buying and crafting better gear and upgrading your private quarters. New jobs and missions from the three factions are also available. The more of those you complete, the higher your faction levels, giving you access to better gear. Special faction campaigns are a great way to learn more about the world of The Cycle: Frontier – especially after a significant expansion in Season 2. <br><br>In addition to the standard issue Co-Tec weapons, you can unlock more powerful gear from the faction arsenal over time, all the way to legendary weapons like the infamous Zeus Beam. You can further modify weapons with a variety of attachments to fit your needs and play style. These range from a simple flashlight, to expanded magazines, armor penetration mods and more. Finally, a new way to add powerful perks to your weapons and equipment lies buried in the depths of Tharis Island, waiting to be discovered!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT'S NEW IN SEASON 3?<\/h2>The latest season for The Cycle: Frontier comes with an array of changes and additions. Keep an eye on the skies as the monstrous Howler makes a landing on Fortuna III and steel yourself for a tough fight as the factions ask you to face the new threat head-on and explore their nests. Wander the streets of an updated Prospect Station and fill your arsenal with a collection of Mk 2 weapons. Finally, advance your prospecting career in an environment where every choice and action matters in the long run.

Each mission includes a unique environment, story, gameplay, and monster. Have fun with your friends trying to complete each eerie paranormal mission, and help PAH Inc. capture the supernatural entities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE DOLLS MISSION STORY<\/h2>You just signed on with PAH Inc. Paranormal Activity Helpers Incorporated, yeah sounds corny, but the pay is great. They said you won't ever be in any real danger, and they have tons of work right now. Your first job is at some old haunted house. There is a broker wanting to put the house for sale, but with everyone in the town spreading rumors of evil living inside the house, he needs some proof that it is safe. He actually seems creeped out himself. Anyway, he hired PAH Inc. to check the place out. You can go check it out alone if you'd like, but I would take at least 3 more friends with me. Check the place out, and if there is anything supernatural going on, try to bring evidence back to PAH Inc.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MYSTERY OF THE HOUSE<\/h2>This house was built over 100 years ago. The owners ran a funeral parlor. They held normal funeral services such as ceremonies, wakes, cremation and burying the dead. The rumor around town is that they also offered a very special service, a way to talk to your deceased loved one on last time. Several people paid for the service, and after some type of ritual, they were able to speak to the dead. Something apparently went wrong during one of the rituals. A person from town and the owners of the house disappeared and were never seen again. Over the last century, a few people that investigated the incident never returned. A few kids sneaking around the place claimed to hear laughter and see a little girl in the window. There probably isn't any truth to any of it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY<\/h2>In Pacify, you will be running for your life around the narrow corridors of a dark, old house. There is a little girl that switches between good and evil roaming around. Different circumstances can cause her to change. Once the evil takes over, it will chase you and your friends all over the house. You must find a way to Pacify the evil and escape the house. As the game progresses, the evil gets smarter and faster.<br><br>Play alone in single player mode, or play with up to 3 more friends in multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, you can choose to play with or against your friends. Read the notes for clues about Pacifying the girl. Find and use keys, dolls, wood and matches to help you on your way. The girl can hear and see you. Stay out of sight, and stay as quiet as possible. Try different types of strategies to win.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single Player Mode<br>You can go in the house alone, but the game will be difficult. You must do the work of 2-4 people all by yourself. It is possible though and very scary to take on the girl all alone! <br><br><\/li><li>Co-Op Mode<br>In co-op multiplayer, you work together trying to help each other escape the house. You can save each other from the girl by interrupting her when she catches someone. <br><br><\/li><li>PVP Mode<br>In pvp mode, everyone is an intern for PAH Inc. vying to get a full time position. The person that does the most work gets hired. You can push each other down and get in each other's way. Pushing a player on the floor stuns them for 5 seconds and causes them to drop their keys.<\/li><\/ul>",

Will you become a shining angel, backed by noble paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else entirely?
